## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
**codex-spec** is a CLI tool that transforms software development from code-first to specification-first, enabling developers to harness OpenAI Codex's full potential through structured, context-aware development workflows.

### Value Proposition
In an era where AI transforms software development, the most valuable skill isn't writing code—it's communicating intent with precision. **codex-spec** makes specifications the executable source of truth, turning development into a systematic process of intent → specification → implementation.

### Target Market
- Individual developers using OpenAI Codex
- Development teams adopting AI-assisted workflows
- Organizations transitioning to Specification-Driven Development
- Software architects designing AI-native development processes

## 2. Product Overview

### Core Mission
Enable developers to implement **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** with OpenAI Codex, where specifications become living, executable documents that drive consistent, high-quality implementations.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Context-Aware Development**: Maintains evolving project context (product, technical, structural)
2. **Plan-Centric Architecture**: Bridges strategic specifications with tactical implementation
3. **Codex-Optimized**: Specifically designed for OpenAI Codex capabilities and patterns
4. **Living Documentation**: Context and plans evolve with the codebase automatically

### Success Metrics
- **Developer Productivity**: 3x faster feature implementation through structured workflows
- **Code Quality**: 50% reduction in rework through precise specifications
- **Team Alignment**: Consistent implementations across team members
- **Context Preservation**: Zero knowledge loss as projects evolve

```

### Secondary Persona: Development Team Lead
**Background**: Technical lead managing team adoption of AI tools  
**Goals**: Team consistency, knowledge sharing, scalable processes  
**Pain Points**: Inconsistent AI usage, knowledge silos, onboarding complexity

### Tertiary Persona: Software Architect
